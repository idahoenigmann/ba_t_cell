[TODO To better understand the mode of action of t cells, the calcium concentration of single cells are measured. The resulting time series can then be analyzed for activation. This work aims to provide an algorithm for automatic detection of activation. To achieve this, the calcium concentration is approximated with sigmoid functions reducing the data set to few parameters, making it easy to study.]

Research questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which criteria can distinguish between unactivated, activated and pre-activated cells?
	\item Do different types of activated cells exists? How are they different?
	\item With which frequencies does the Calcium concentration repeat after activation?
	\item Is there a difference in frequencies between mouse and human cells?
\end{itemize}
