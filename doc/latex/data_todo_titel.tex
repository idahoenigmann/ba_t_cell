\chapter{Generating Data of the Calcium Concentration}
\label{chapter:data}

From section~\ref{sec:t-cell/activation}, we gather that analysing the intracellular \Calcium concentration gives us good insight in whether and when a cell activates. Additionally, it can be measured relatively easily by the method presented in this chapter.

\section{Structure of the Data}
\label{sec:structure_of_data}

First, we describe the structure of the data this work uses. 
The data matrix has one row for each combination of tracked particle and frame number. In this context cells are called particles as the recording might feature non-cells that are detected as a cell and recorded in the data set. The information stored for each particle and frame combination is described in detail in table~\ref{tab:information_data_matrix}.

One recording can have between 500 and 10000 particles. The length is between 700 and 1000 frames, which corresponds to approximately 11 to 17 minutes. The ratio recorded is typically between 0 and 5.

Four recordings were generated, with two each from human and mouse cells. For each cell type a positive and negative control was measured. In a positive control the conditions are such, that in theory every cell should activate, while in negative control the conditions are such, that none should activate. Due to stress on the cells a few cells will activate before the recording starts, during the recording in the negative control or not activate at all in the positive control, regardless of the conditions. Stress can be caused by movement, changes in temperature and other factors.

%\section{Jurkat Cells, 5c.c7 Primary Mouse T Cells and Fura-2}
%\label{sec:jurkat_cells_primary_mouse_t_cells_and_fura2}

%According to Morgan and Lindsay, the prototypical cell line to study T cell signalling is the Jurkat cell line~\cite{morgan2023}. It was obtained from the blood of a young male human with T cell leukaemia, as described by Schneider et al.~\cite{schneider1977}. Different cell lines within the Jurkat family are described by Abraham and Weiss~\cite{abraham2004}. They provide a timeline of discoveries linked to Jurkat cells and T cell receptor signalling. Another type of T cells used in signalling studies are gathered from mice.

\section{Measuring the Calcium Concentration of T Cells}

Jurkat cells and 5c.c7 primary mouse T cells are two T cell lines widely used.
In order to be able to measure the intracellular \Calcium concentration of cells they can be labelled with Fura-2. Martinez et al. depict how this method provides a way to record the \Calcium concentration of multiple cells over a time period~\cite{martinez2017}. Challenges encountered when using Fura-2 on certain cell types are described by Roe, Lemasters and Herman along with their respective solutions~\cite{roe1990}.

After the cells have been labelled with Fura-2, a recording of up to 15 to 20 minutes can be generated. To achieve this the cells and stimulant are photographed once per second at both 340nm and 380nm wavelength. The resolution of the images are 1.6$\mu$m per pixel. By calculating the ratio of the two images at each pixel the \Calcium concentration can be observed. An exemplary resulting image showing the ratio is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:example_ratio_img}. The T cells appear a lighter shade than the background when activated and darker when not activated.

	\label{fig:example_ratio_img}
\end{figure}

To activate the cells in the duration of the recording they are transferred to a plate covered with replicas of the MHC-peptide complex normally present on APCs. This plate is then recorded as described above. For a negative control the plate is not covered with peptides, while for the positive control the peptide covering on the plate is very dense. Recordings of different densities in peptides lead to activation of a percentage of T cells.

\section{Processing the Data}

To track single T cells moving around during the video the sum of the 340nm and 380nm image of each second is calculated. This image provides the basis for separating T cells from the background. On this image all T cells will appear similarly light in colour. Therefore, it is used to track the movement of cells. Each cell is numbered, such that the same cell will have the same number during the video. For some cells the trajectory tracking is not perfect, resulting in a split of the numbering into multiple numbers for the same cell. The position and shade during both 340nm and 380nm as well as the ratio of each particle and each frame is then recorded into the data structure used in this work. The first roughly 50 frames at the start of the recording are discarded due to the video being out of focus. Additionally, cells only appearing in fewer than 300 frames are discarded as they most likely represent trajectories incorrectly tracked or split. The resulting data is then stored in a matrix structured as described in table~\ref{tab:information_data_matrix}.
