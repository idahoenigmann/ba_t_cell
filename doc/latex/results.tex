This chapter gives answers to the questions from chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction}. To answer the methods described in this work, such as approximation, clustering and outlier detection, are combined and used.

\section{Proposed algorithm for Detecting Activated T Cells}
\label{sec:proposed-algorithm}

The first and most relevant question was ''Which criteria can distinguish between unactivated, activated and pre-activated cells?''.

First we give a method for filtering the pre-activated cells from a dataset. From their nature we expect a high value in \Calcium concentration at the start of the recording. Using the approximation from chapter~\ref{chapter:approximating} it is easy to get the approximate \Calcium concentration value at the start of the recording, as it is the parameter $u$. Using the algorithm~\ref{alg:outlier_detection} with parameters threshold as $[\infty, 0.5]$ and parameters\_used as [$u$] gives good results. It returns the indices of particles, which are pre-activated in the data sets of the positive controls.

After having filtered out pre-activated particles, we want to distinguish between unactivated and activated particles. For this we propose the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item get positive control, negative control and experiment recordings
	\item transform each particle time series of all three data sets to the parameter list by approximating it with a combination of sigmoid functions, according to chapter~\ref{chapter:approximating}, using the algorithm \ref{alg:main}
	\item use outlier detection, which is described in algorithm~\ref{alg:outlier_detection}, to filter out non-conforming cells from both the positive and negative control, as well as pre-activated cells, and particles where the approximation yielded suboptimal results
	\item use clustering method, as one described in chapter~\ref{chapter:clustering}, with parameters of filtered negative and positive control as input to get the clustering parameters
	\item predict the membership of the experiment particle parameters to the clusters to get a prediction of activation
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm is implemented in Python and shown in appendix~\ref{chapter:python_implementation}.

[TODO results of applying it to experiment data]

The algorithm can be adapted by using different clustering methods, or specifying other methods of separating the particles based on the parameters derived.


\section{Types of Activated Cells}

Now that we have an algorithm for detecting activated cells, we might ask whether there are different types of activated cells. The question formulated in chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction} is ''Do different types of activated cells exists? How are they different?''

We find an answer by applying a clustering to the activated cells only. We have two data sets of activated cells, one from mouse cells and one from human cells. Naturally there will be differences between the two. Interesting however is how they differ. Additionally, we might look at clustering performed on only one filtered positive control dataset.

[TODO results of applying clustering to both pos controls and each one individually]

\section{Oscillation in Decrease}

Question: With which frequencies does the Calcium concentration repeat after activation?

Answer: Results from frequency analysis

\section{Difference between Mouse and Human Cells}

Question: Is there a difference in frequencies between mouse and human cells?

Answer: Compare mean and covariance between the two.
